# Queue Operations in C

This project implements various queue operations in C using an array-based approach. It includes fundamental queue functions like enqueue and dequeue, along with additional operations such as reversing odd numbers, swapping elements, and inserting at specific indices.

## Features
- ✅ **Basic Queue Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Check if Empty/Full  
- 🔍 **Find Maximum**: Get the largest value in the queue  
- 🔄 **Swap First & Last**: Swap the first and last elements  
- ✨ **Insert at Index**: Insert an element at a specific index  
- 🔁 **Reverse Odd Numbers**: Reverse only the odd elements while keeping even numbers in place  
- ⏪ **Reverse First K Elements**: Reverse the first `k` elements in the queue  
- 🖥️ **Interactive Menu**: A menu-driven program for testing the functions
